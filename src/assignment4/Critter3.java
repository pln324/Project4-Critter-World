 * "Dora"
 * An exploring critter
 * Will methodically try to walk on every space in the entire world.
 * Will walk down until all coordinates in the vertical line have been walked on.
 * Then it will move one block to the right and repeat.
 * If the critter does not have enough energy to walk, it will stand still until it does.
 * In an encounter, the critter will always fight.
 * When the world has been entirely explored, it will attempt to reproduce and try to die.
 * It will try to die by standing still and not fighting during any encounters after it has explored everything.
